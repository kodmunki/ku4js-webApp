 * _build (This build script and the yuicompressor)

The following variables found in setup () are
expected to be changed by the developer running
this process:

* LIBRARY (The library to build for or {} for none)
* PROJNAME (The name of your project)
* STARTMSG (A message to echo at start of build)
* ENDMSG (A message to echo at end of build)
